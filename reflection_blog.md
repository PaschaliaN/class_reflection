<h2>Paschalia's Reflection</h2>

<p>This class was as enjoyable as I expected it to be the first time I walked in class. It came in the course hoping that I would learn how to code, I wasn't aware that I would be leaving the course with the ability to create abstract, informative and creative pieces through code.

The class was challenging just because coding was an unfamiliar skill. Initially, coding scared me because most of the time I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't know how much I can create; it was quite an anxiety-inducing process initially.  
As time progressed, I learned how to utilize resources like our class website,  p5.js website and Daniel Shiffman's videos. However, the process is still challenging, and I am aware that I will have to continue learning outside of class and I feel like coding can quickly become a hobby now that I am graduating and I have a lot of time to focus on personal development and developing skills on my pace.  
Since I am a designer and artist, I enjoyed the aesthetic design part of the creative process. I enjoyed planning and writing down my ideas without worrying about how I am going to execute them in code. It was a trial error process every time, and at the end, I settled for the paths that were feasible with my skills and time.

Other than websites(that I learned to create using HTML, CSS, and WordPress) I am used to creating a design that is not interactive with my user, It was fascinating that I could create designs that users would interact with and won't experience as print or images on their screen.

Personally, this academic year has been challenging just because I was worried about post-graduation plans most of the time and that is where my focus was throughout the school year. I wish I knew about this class as a lowerclassmen when I didn't have to worry about adulting, and all my attention was academics and thoroughly enjoying my classes nevertheless, I am thrilled I took this class.
